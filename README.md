# Project Movies
In this pair-programming assignment were creating a page in React were we displayed popular movies from an API by using Routs, Navigate etc. 

## The problem

We started this task by doing a sketch of the pages and the different components in Figma.
We were planning to make alot of components, but we later on discovered that it was just to overcomplicate things and felt unneccesarry so we kept it simple and clean instead.
