In this pair-programming assignment were creating a page in React were we displayed popular movies from an API by using Routs, Navigate etc. 

## The problem

We started this task by doing a sketch of the pages and the different components in Figma. We did the sketch with only to pages and 2 components but it ended up being 8 components in total. This was a fun project!
